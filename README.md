## Tech Stack
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Topics Learned
**CSS:**
- **Background Position Property:** This property is used to position a background image. It takes two values first value is for the horizontal position and the other is for the vertical position.

**JavaScript:**
- **Input from HTML input tag:** In JavaScript, input value from HTML can be accessed by using the **".value"** method on the input element in HTML.
- **Enter key event listener:** On the desktop, the user prefers using the enter key to submit input rather than using submit button but the input tag doesn't submit value on enter. This Problem can be tackled by adding a **"keypress event listener"**. **If** the pressed key is enter (we can access the pressed key by **" event.key === "enter" "**), we can **click submit button** by using the **btn. click()** method.
- **Local Storage:** Local storage in the browser **stores** an object (i.e. in **key-value pair**) whose **keys and values are always strings** **(integer keys are automatically converted to strings)**. Operations that can be performed are **Adding an item** to the local storage - **"localStorage.setItem("key", "value")"**, **Reading an item** from the local storage - **"localStorage.getItem("key")"**, **Removing an item** from the local storage - **"localStorage.removeItem("key")"**, **Clearing the local storage - "localStorage.clear()"**
